	<!-- About Page -->
	Hello world!<br><br>
	We are the up and coming Team Goat. We are a team of young adults participating in the 2014 Koding Virtual Hack.
	This site came up as an idea of making our lives easier. What if we could have made this whole site at the same time?
	Something all coders would like to do but never have the chance without a middle man. Well we heard your cries and created a solution!
	*insert site name* was created by coders for coders so we tried to tie in things that we all love such as chat boxes, 
	usernames (so you can be whoever you want), and of course the feature of simultanious coding.
	We hope you enjoy the product and look forward to hearing your feedback.
	<br>
	~Team Goat Staff
